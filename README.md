# CS32---C++ Level-2
This is project 4 in my class, which was taken in Spring 2021 and was taught by Professor David Smallberg.

Project 4 is one of the 2 biggest projets in CS32 class, which is emphasized in data structures.
For this project, we will build a simple database in memory and process database queries.
A simple database table is a collection of records. Each record has the same number of fields.

We must implement the tree or hash table data structure. My code used Hash Table with 1000 number of buckets (to make it easier for testing program).

This project was assigned in the last week of the quarter, which is a very hectic week, so I did this in only 3 days. With that being said, my code is not perfect and it could be re-organized or improve to speed up.
Professor Smallberg never releases the grade for this project but it works perfectly well and meets all of his requirements. At least, the last time I checked, the code was still right.
Feel free to use it as a reference.
